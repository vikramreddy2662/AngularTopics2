when we use the same dependency injection and inject same instance of service class to parent component and it's child components 
then dependency injection in child component overrides dependency injection of its parent class .

child class provider overrides parent parent class provider.

Instead of providing provider of class in each  child component to access the same instance of a service class we can add provider 
in component class of  a parent component  and use it in each child component.

Providing dependency injection(provider) in header, module and parent component and using them in child component class is called hierarchical 
dependency injection.

Injecting instance of one angular service class into anonther angular service class.
using @Injectable.

we use  provider  in angular iun component class ,module etc in  application to specify adn to provide a type of instance that
need to be injected 
provider has two components provide and use class {provide:token-name,useclass:serviceclassName}
token name can be used to inject dependency in all the components whereever it's required.
for that we need to use @inject(token-name) in constructor();

to provide provider name directly in angular service class we can provide it by using providerIn  in @Injectable in service class.
